> React Native Elements has UI elements that are easy to use & really customizable. It also has theming, platform specific search bars, [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) support, and much more.

It's finally here! Let's put our hands together and welcome React Native Elements 1.0 ðŸŽ‰

This release is centered around making the RNE components that everyone loves more mature and stable. This is not to say that all work is done, but this is definetly a giant leap in the right direction and one that we have been working on for over a year.

I want to thank you to our users for using RNE and giving us feedback through issues on the repo and also the contributors who have taken time out to contribute and improve RNE together. And most importantly, I want to say thanks to Kyle Roach and Xavier without whom this project would not have been as awesome as it is today.

This blog post is meant to serve as a migration guide for updgrading to `react-native-elements: "^1.0.0"` and also a way to document and share all the breaking changes, new features and other improvements in this release.

The wait is over!! Get excited, cause we certainly are. 14K ðŸŒŸ and counting...

## Installation
First, install the library using your favorite package manager: `yarn add react-native-elements`

Also if you are using an older version, just update the `react-native-elements` version to `^1.0.0`

## Breaking changes
- `<FormInput />` is now `<Input />` component - Input was rewritten from scratch to make it easier to use and more functional. It should mostly work the same, but checkout the docs for a few props that might have changed.

- Support for React Native Web
- Theming support across components - easily build light & dark modes
- New `<Image />` component - displays images with a placeholder and smooth image load transitioning
- New `<Input />` component - a branch new and improved replacement for `<FormInput />`
- New Tap Rating `<AirbnbRating />` component - powered by `react-native-ratings`
- Platform-specific `<SearchBar />` component - drop-in usage with native look and feel
- Slider - supports `vertical` orientation
- Close to 100% Types coverage

## Assorted fixes & improvements
- Improved Avatar component
